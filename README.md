Tesseract OCR with Accord Image Processing to improve quality


This is a implemention of Charles Weld's Tesseract dot.net wrapper https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract along with the Accord .net framework https://github.com/accord-net/framework  to create a OCR engine with automated image enhancement.  


By using Accord's Deskewing/Sharpening and Grayscaling filters the OCR rate has improved greatly.

the Zip contains a Sample Application with a example usage.
